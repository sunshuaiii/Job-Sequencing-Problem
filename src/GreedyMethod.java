/**
 * Algorithm:
 * 1) Sort all jobs in decreasing order of profit.
 * 2) Iterate on jobs in decreasing order of profit.
 *    For each job , do the following :
 * a) Find a time slot i, such that slot is empty and i < deadline and i is greatest.
 *    Put the job in this slot and mark this slot filled.
 * b) If no such i exists, then ignore the job.
 * 
 * Time Complexity is O(n^2)
